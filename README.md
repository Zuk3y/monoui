## Getting Started

MonoUI requires no installation — simply choose a component you like, copy the code, and paste it into your project.

### Requirements

- Tailwind CSS v4.1 or later
- For components with icons, if you prefer not to use raw `<svg>` elements, you can copy JSX icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/).

## Usage

1. Find a component you like.
2. Preview it and test how it looks across different screen sizes using the built-in breakpoint toggles.
3. Toggle the preview to show the source code and click the `</> Copy` button.
4. Paste the copied code into your project.

> All components support dark mode and are fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Components

MonoUI offers a wide variety of completely free components, with more planned for the future!
